Request Format
The JSON body can include:

"email": A string representing the customer's email address.
"phoneNumber": A string representing the customer's phone number.
The app can be checked on: https://fluxkart.frenchschool.in/
TechStack:<br>
The service is implemented using:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for server-side applications.
Express: A web framework for Node.js, simplifying API development and routing.
